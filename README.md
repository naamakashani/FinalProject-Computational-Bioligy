How to use the code? 
The goal of the project is to characterize all TRT events in ccRCC patients and to test whether they have the potential to generate neoantigens.
In order to do this, we built a pipeline that will allow us to identify the locations independently, cut between the results, 
characterize them and finally make a prediction of neoantigens for each patient.
the file ARTDeco is the code in order to run the tool ARTDeco.
the file rnaseQC is the code in order to run Quality control for the bams.
the file Arriba is the code to run Arriba.
the file summary_intersect_dogs_arriba.txt is intended for intersection between the tools Arriba and ARTDeco 
the file elife.ipynb is intended for intersection between the elife and ARTDeco.
the file igv_screenshots.py is intended for visualize the result by IGV
and the plot files are intended to make plots and conclusions for all of the results.
